# Summary
This repo contains the final project for George Washington University's DATS6202: Machine Learning 1 course. The objective of the final project is to apply a machine learning network or algorithm covered in the course to a real world problem.

# File Structure
The files in this repo are organized and contained in the following folders:
1. **Proposal**
   - A proposal for our project
2. **Code**

   This folder contains our data, two code files, and output files from our code. The "2.gridsearch" file can take 80 minutes to run depending on your computer. Run "1.model" if you do not have the time to run "2.gridsearch" to pull from our results.
   - 1. 1.model - run best model
   - 2. 2.gridsearch - gridsearch to evaluate best hyperparamters for various models
   - 3. Histogram Comparison - plot comparing actual to predicted
   - 4. Scatter-PolicOperBudg - plot comparing the effect of change in Police Operating Budget on predicted Violent Crimes using our model
   - 5. Scatter-PolicPerPop - plot comparing the effect of change in Poice per Population on predicted Violent Crimes using our model
   - 6. communities.data - data
   - 7. communities.names - column names
   - 8. modeleval-full - gridsearch results for full dataset
   - 9. modeleval-impute - gridsearch results for imputed dataset
3. **Final Report**
   - A final written report that explains the data, setup, and results of the project.
4. **Presentation**
   - A story of the project process and results
